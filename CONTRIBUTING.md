# Contributing to our ModMail bot
If you want to contribute to our Discord bot you are at the right place.

<hr>

## What do I require before getting started?
You have to know Python and basics of Discord.py(the language which we use for the bot).


## What can I contribute?
You can add new features to the bot, add new things that the bot doesn't have them yet.


### Contributing Code

Fork the repository and then clone it.

Now you need a Discord bot to work with. If you don't have one make sure to create one, then invite it to your server.

Now rename secrets.env.template to secrets.env
Insert your bots token there.

Then install the requirements:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

And finally to run the bot:

```python launcher.py```

If you need any help open an issue.

After you have finished writing the code open a PR.
